Files
1.File Creation
To create a file -createNewFile()
Above will be returning boolean value- true if file creted
									   false if file already exists
Throws IOException
It was thown when the specified file or directory does not exist, an IOException occurs.

2.Read using FileInputStream
 Creates an input file stream to read from the specified File object. 
 used to read bytes
 throws FileNotFoundException
 available()  - 
 getFD()   -   
 read()/read(b bytes)/read(b bytes,int off,int len)
 
 3.write using FileOutputStream
 outputstream for writing data/streams of raw bytes to file or storing data to file
write(): this writes the single byte to the file output stream.
write(byte[] array): this writes the specified arrayâ€™s bytes to the output stream.
write(byte[] array, int start, int length): this writes the number of bytes equal to length to the output stream from an array starting from the position start.

4.writing object into file
to write a object into file ,class of the object must be Serializable
Serialization is process of converting object into byte stream
ObjectOutputStream used for serialization
Class marked as Serializable indicates that it can be converted into byte stream
*Create a serializable Class
*Create FileOutputStream
*Create ObjectOutputStream and pass FileOutputStream as argument
*ObjectOutputStream.writeObject() to write
-Data in file is in binary format

5.Reading object from file
*FileInputStream is used to read bytes
*ObjectInputStream used to deserialize bytes into object
