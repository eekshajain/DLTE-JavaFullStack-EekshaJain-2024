rest used for json
soap used for xml


JBoss: JBoss provides a Java EE-based application server runtime platform.

 resp.setContentType("application/json"); The content type specifies the format of the data being sent in the response body.
 
 Gson to convert object to Json format
 
 For task 
 -create entity for 3
 -middleware having connection,statements,result set,loggers,exception
    (add new transaction-check if new merchant exists)
	
web service provides cross platform support


To build-> clean package

SOAP-simple object access protocol
 
Marshaling object to xml
Unmarshaling xml to object
JAXB manages all these conversion

object factory to convert object to xml and vice versa

while working with object in SOAP must create a intermediate to convert

REST (Representational State Transfer):
When to Use REST:
Simplicity: Choose REST for straightforward scenarios where simplicity is key.
Public APIs: REST is widely used for public APIs over the Internet.
Browser Clients: REST is preferred for web applications accessed via browsers.
Statelessness: RESTful services are stateless, making them suitable for scalable and distributed systems.
Performance: REST is efficient, supports caching, and works well with existing web infrastructure.
JSON: If you prefer working with JSON data, REST is a natural fit.
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):
When to Use SOAP:
Complex Scenarios: Use SOAP for complex scenarios where security, transactions, and reliability are critical.
Legacy Systems: SOAP is still relevant for integrating with legacy systems.
Fixed Standards: SOAP 1.2 has fixed many perceived shortcomings and is widely adopted.
XML: If you need to work with XML-based messages, SOAP is a good choice.
RPC-Style Communication: SOAP supports remote procedure calls (RPC) and structured data.
Considerations:
Overhead:
REST has less overhead compared to SOAP due to its simplicity.
SOAP relies on XML and has additional complexity.
Interoperability:
Both REST and SOAP can work across domains, but SOAP has stricter standards.
REST is more flexible and browser-friendly.
General Rule of Thumb:
REST: Use REST unless thereâ€™s a compelling reason to use SOAP.
SOAP: Choose SOAP for specific use cases, legacy systems, or when fixed standards are necessary
