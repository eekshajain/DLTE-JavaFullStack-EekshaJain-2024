REST, which stands for Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
 REST is based on a set of principles that emphasize simplicity, scalability, and statelessness.

### What is REST?
- **Resource-based**: REST treats data and functionality as resources that can be accessed and manipulated using standard HTTP methods.
- **Statelessness**: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary to process the request. 
					Servers do not store any client state between requests.
- **Uniform interface**: RESTful APIs use a uniform interface consisting of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and resource identifiers
						(URLs) to interact with resources.
- **Representation**: Resources are represented in various formats such as JSON, XML, or HTML, allowing clients to request and receive 
					representations of resources that suit their needs.
- **Hypermedia**: RESTful APIs may include hypermedia links in responses to allow clients to discover and navigate related resources dynamically.

### When to use REST?
- **Building Web Services**: REST is commonly used for designing web services and APIs that expose functionality over the internet. 
							It's suitable for scenarios where clients need to interact with remote servers to perform CRUD operations on resources.
- **Microservices Architecture**: RESTful APIs are well-suited for implementing microservices architectures, where complex applications are decomposed 
								into smaller, independently deployable services. Each microservice can expose a RESTful API for communication 
								with other services and clients.
- **Integration with Web and Mobile Clients**: RESTful APIs are ideal for integrating with web and mobile clients, as they leverage standard 
						HTTP methods and data formats. They allow clients to access and manipulate resources using familiar protocols and technologies.

### Why use REST?
1. **Simplicity**: RESTful APIs are based on simple and intuitive principles, making them easy to understand, implement, and use. 
						They leverage existing HTTP protocols and conventions, reducing the need for custom client or server logic.
2. **Scalability**: RESTful APIs are stateless and can handle a large number of concurrent requests, making them highly scalable.
					Servers can distribute requests across multiple instances or scale horizontally to accommodate growing traffic.
3. **Flexibility**: RESTful APIs support various client types and data formats, allowing clients to access resources using different devices 
					and platforms. They enable loose coupling between clients and servers, allowing them to evolve independently.
4. **Interoperability**: RESTful APIs are platform-independent and can be implemented using any programming language or framework that supports HTTP.
						They promote interoperability between different systems and enable seamless integration with third-party services.
5. **Caching**: RESTful APIs leverage HTTP caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce network latency. 
				Clients can cache responses and reuse them for subsequent requests, reducing the need for redundant data transfers.
