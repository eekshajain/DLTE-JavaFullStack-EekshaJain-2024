In the provided configuration, payee.port and payee.target.name.space are used to set the port type name and target namespace for the generated WSDL.

Port Type Name (payee.port):
The port type name defines the abstract interface of the web service. It typically specifies the operations that the service supports and the messages involved in those operations.
In the configuration, defaultWsdl11Definition.setPortTypeName(resourceBundle.getString("payee.port")) sets the port type name using the value retrieved from the resource bundle.
For example, if payee.port is set to PayeePort, the generated WSDL will have a <portType> element with the name PayeePort.


Target Namespace (payee.target.name.space):
The target namespace is a unique identifier for the XML elements defined in the WSDL document. It helps in avoiding naming conflicts between different services.
In the configuration, defaultWsdl11Definition.setTargetNamespace(resourceBundle.getString("payee.target.name.space")) sets the target namespace using the value retrieved from the resource bundle.
For example, if payee.target.name.space is set to http://payee.services, all elements defined in the generated WSDL will belong to the namespace http://payee.services.
These properties are crucial for defining the structure and semantics of the generated WSDL. They ensure that the WSDL is correctly interpreted by clients consuming the web service
