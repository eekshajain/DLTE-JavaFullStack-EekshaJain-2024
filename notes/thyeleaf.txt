**Thymeleaf** is a powerful **template engine** used in web development, particularly with **Spring Boot** applications. Let's explore why and when you might use the special symbols **`$`** and **`@`** in Thymeleaf:

1. **`$` (Dollar Sign) - Variable Expressions**:
    - **Purpose**: To access and display values from the **model attributes** (data provided by the server) within your HTML templates.
    - **Usage Example**:
        - Suppose you have a `user` object with a `name` property. You can display the user's name using:
          ```html
          <p>User Name: <span th:text="${user.name}"></span></p>
          ```
    - **Advantages**:
        - **Dynamic Content**: Allows you to dynamically insert data into your views.
        - **Cleaner Code**: Reduces the need for hardcoding values directly in HTML.
        - **Integration with Model**: Seamlessly integrates with Spring model attributes.

2. **`@` (At Sign) - Link Expressions**:
    - **Purpose**: To rewrite URLs within your templates.
    - **Usage Example**:
        - When creating links, you can use `@{...}` expressions to ensure proper URL rewriting:
          ```html
          <a th:href="@{/products/details/{productId}(productId=${product.id})}">Product Details</a>
          ```
    - **Advantages**:
        - **URL Rewriting**: Automatically handles URL rewriting based on the application context.
        - **Consistent Links**: Ensures consistent and valid URLs across different environments (e.g., development, production).

3. **Other Special Symbols**:
    - **`*` (Asterisk) - Form Backing Bean Expressions**: Used for form fields and form submission.
    - **`#` (Hash) - Internationalization Expressions**: Used for localization and message externalization.
    - **`{...}` (Curly Braces) - Variable Expressions**: General variable expressions for dynamic content.

In summary, Thymeleaf simplifies template rendering, integrates well with Spring, and provides a clean way to handle dynamic data and URLs in your web applications. üåü¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥

In **Thymeleaf**, the **asterisk** (**`*`**) symbol is used for **form backing bean expressions**. Let's explore its purpose and usage:

1. **Form Backing Bean Expressions**:
    - **Purpose**: To work with form fields and handle form submissions.
    - **Usage Example**:
        - Suppose you have a form with an input field named `username`. You can bind the user input to a form backing bean property using the asterisk expression:
          ```html
          <input type="text" th:field="*{username}" />
          ```
        - Here, `*{username}` binds the value entered by the user to the `username` property in the form backing bean.
    - **Advantages**:
        - **Data Binding**: Allows seamless data binding between form fields and Java objects.
        - **Validation**: Useful for form validation and processing user input.

Remember that the asterisk expression is specifically used for form-related tasks in Thymeleaf. üåü¬≤¬≥
